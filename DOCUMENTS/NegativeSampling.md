#### Implementation of Negative Sampling in this CBOW model.
---
In the CBOW training loop, Negative Sampling can be implemented within the training loop, specifically in the section where the forward and backward propagation occur. Hereâ€™s how it can be integrated
1. **Before Forward Propagation**: After retrieving the current word pair, you can introduce a method to generate negative samples. This would involve selecting a set of negative words (i.e., words that are not related to the current context) based on your vocabulary. **In this method, make sure to avoid selecting the center/target word itself or any of the context words as negative samples**.
 ```C++
/*    
    In CBOW, we are predicting the central word, not the context.
    So, the negative samples should be words that are not the central word (target) but could be drawn from the entire vocabulary.

    A better way to phrase it:
    We need to randomly select words from the vocabulary that are not the target (central) word when given a context of surrounding words.
    These negative samples help the model learn to distinguish between the true target word and unrelated words.

    Is it ok to not find a single vocabulary word which is not in the center of context window?
    In a large enough corpus, every word in the vocabulary could potentially be the central word for some context window at some point.

/**
 * @brief Generates negative samples for the CBOW model using negative sampling.
 *
 * This function selects a set of negative samples (words) that are not related to the current target word (central word) being predicted.
 * Negative samples are randomly drawn from the vocabulary,
 * and the function ensures that the generated negative samples do not include the target word (central word) of the current context.
 * These negative samples are used to train the model to differentiate between the correct (target) word and unrelated (negative) words.
 *
 * @tparam E - Type of the elements, typically used for indexing and storing sizes.
 *             Defaults to the size type of cc_tokenizer::string_character_traits<char>.
 *
 * @param vocab - Reference to the corpus vocabulary from which to generate negative samples. 
 *                It must contain the method numberOfUniqueTokens(), which returns the total number 
 *                of unique words in the vocabulary.
 *
 * @param pair - Pointer to the word pair, representing the center/target word, left and right context words in the CBOW model.
 *               The pair object should have methods getLeft() and getRight() that return arrays of context words.
 *
 * @param n - The number of negative samples to generate. Defaults to the size of the skip-gram window (SKIP_GRAM_WINDOW_SIZE).
 *          - Typically, a small number of negative samples (5-20 per positive sample) are selected to avoid too many unnecessary computations.
 *
 * @throws ala_exception - Throws this exception in case of memory allocation errors (`std::bad_alloc`) 
 *                         or length issues (`std::length_error`) during dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * @return cc_tokenizer::string_character_traits<char>::size_type* - Returns a pointer to an array of negative samples.
 *                                                                   The array contains `n` negative samples, where 
 *                                                                   each sample is an index into the vocabulary.
 *                                                                   The caller is responsible for deallocating this memory 
 *                                                                   to avoid memory leaks.
