 Your question about preferring the second session (Run 2) due to its lack of spikes in epoch loss compared to the first session (Run 1) is a practical and insightful one. Let’s address this and clarify whether this preference is a standard approach when training models like CBOW Word2Vec, or if it’s specific to your situation.

## Analysis of Your Preference for Run 2

- **Run 1**: Shows a minor fluctuation in loss (epoch 14 to 15: 0.130057 to 0.132214) but achieves a final loss of 0.112518.
- **Run 2**: Has no fluctuations, with a smooth, monotonic loss decrease, and a slightly lower final loss of 0.105484.

Your preference for Run 2 because it lacks spikes (fluctuations) in epoch loss is understandable, as a smoother loss curve often feels more reliable. Let’s break down whether this is a standard practice in training models like Word2Vec and how it applies to your case.

## Is Preferring Smoother Loss Curves Standard in Practice?

In general, when training machine learning models (including Word2Vec), practitioners often prefer smoother loss curves, but the reasoning depends on context. Here’s how this applies:

1. **Smoother Curves Suggest Stability**:
   - A smooth, monotonic decrease in loss, like in Run 2, typically indicates stable training dynamics. It suggests that the learning rate, model architecture, and data are well-aligned, allowing the model to make consistent progress toward minimizing the loss.
   - Fluctuations, like the small spike in Run 1 (epoch 14 to 15), can occur due to stochasticity in training (e.g., random sampling of context-target pairs or weight initialization) or a learning rate that’s slightly too high, causing minor overshooting. In your case, the spike is small (0.130057 to 0.132214), and the loss resumes its downward trend, so it’s not a major concern.

2. **Small Dataset Amplifies Variability**:
   - With only 14 lines of text, your dataset is extremely small, leading to high variance in training. The stochastic nature of CBOW (e.g., random sampling of contexts or negative samples) can cause minor fluctuations, as seen in Run 1. Run 2’s smoother curve might be due to a “luckier” random seed or sampling sequence, but both runs are quite similar overall.
   - In practice, with larger datasets, these fluctuations tend to smooth out because the model sees more diverse examples per epoch, reducing the impact of stochasticity.

3. **Practical Model Selection**:
   - In machine learning, practitioners don’t typically choose between training runs based solely on the smoothness of the loss curve. Instead, they evaluate the model’s performance on a validation set or downstream task (e.g., word similarity, analogy tasks, or clustering for Word2Vec). A smoother curve is preferred only if it correlates with better performance on these tasks.
   - In your case, the final losses (0.112518 for Run 1 vs. 0.105484 for Run 2) are very close, and both runs converge to similar values. The small spike in Run 1 doesn’t seem to harm its overall convergence, so it’s unlikely to be a meaningful difference in practice.

4. **Your Specific Case**:
   - Your preference for Run 2’s smoother curve is reasonable, especially since you’re working with a small dataset where fluctuations might feel more concerning. The smoother curve gives you confidence that the model is learning consistently.
   - Is it just you? It’s not just you—many practitioners prefer smoother loss curves intuitively, as they suggest stable training. However, in professional settings, the decision would hinge on validation performance rather than the loss curve’s appearance alone. Since your dataset is tiny, you’re more sensitive to fluctuations, which is understandable but not necessarily a definitive reason to discard Run 1.

## Recommendations for Your Next Steps

Since you’re planning to wrap up this thread to study negative sampling, learning rate decay, and regularization, here’s how to proceed with your immediate plan (testing smaller vector dimensions) and how to address the Run 1 vs. Run 2 question:

1. **Test Smaller Vector Dimensions**:
   - Reducing the vector size from 100 to 60 or 20 is a great next step, as 100 dimensions are likely overparameterized for 14 lines of text. Try:
     ```bash
     ./RUN.cmd e 17 lr 0.025 dim 60 output
     ./RUN.cmd e 17 lr 0.025 dim 20 output
     ```
   - Compare the loss curves and final losses. A smaller dimensionality should converge faster (fewer parameters) and reduce overfitting risk, though the loss values might differ slightly due to the reduced model capacity.

2. **Evaluate Both Runs**:
   - To decide between Run 1 and Run 2, evaluate their embeddings:
     - **Visualize**: Use t-SNE or PCA to plot the embeddings from both runs. Check if similar words (based on your domain knowledge of the 14 lines) cluster together.
     - **Cosine Similarity**: If you have a few word pairs, compute cosine similarities to see if the embeddings capture expected relationships.
     - **Qualitative Check**: Print the nearest neighbors for a few key words using cosine similarity to inspect the embeddings manually.
   - If the embeddings from Run 1 and Run 2 perform similarly, the small spike in Run 1 is negligible, and you could choose Run 2 for its slightly lower loss or smoother curve.

3. **Run Multiple Trials**:
   - Since you’ve seen slight differences between runs (e.g., Run 1’s spike vs. Run 2’s smoothness), run the training 3–5 times with the same hyperparameters (e.g., lr=0.025, dim=100, 17 epochs) to observe the variability. This will help you determine if Run 1’s fluctuation is common or an outlier.
   - If most runs are smooth like Run 2, your preference for smooth curves is justified. If fluctuations like Run 1’s are common, they’re likely due to the small dataset’s stochasticity and not a problem.

4. **Study New Concepts**:
   - **Negative Sampling**: This is an optimization technique in Word2Vec where, instead of computing softmax over the entire vocabulary, you sample a few “negative” words (unrelated to the context) to update the model. It’s faster and often performs better on small datasets. Check if your implementation uses negative sampling (common default: 5–10 negative samples) or hierarchical softmax.
   - **Learning Rate Decay**: Implement linear decay (e.g., reduce lr from 0.025 to 0.001 over 17 epochs) to fine-tune the model in later epochs, potentially lowering the final loss further.
   - **Regularization**: Add weight decay (L2 regularization) or dropout to prevent overfitting, especially with your small dataset.

5. **Don’t Overemphasize Smoothness**:
   - While Run 2’s smoother curve is appealing, the difference between the two runs is minor (final losses differ by ~0.007). Unless validation shows Run 2’s embeddings are significantly better, the spike in Run 1 isn’t a dealbreaker. Focus on embedding quality over loss curve aesthetics.

## Final Answer to Your Question

Your preference for Run 2’s smoother loss curve is not “just you”—it’s a common intuition in machine learning, as smooth curves suggest stable training. However, in practice, model selection is based on validation performance (e.g., embedding quality for Word2Vec) rather than loss curve smoothness alone. With your small dataset, minor fluctuations like Run 1’s are expected due to stochasticity, and both runs are likely producing similar embeddings given their close final losses. To confirm, evaluate the embeddings from both runs using visualization or similarity tasks. Moving forward, testing smaller vector dimensions (60 or 20) is a great plan, and studying negative sampling, learning rate decay, and regularization will further enhance your implementation.

## Wrapping Up

This is a great point to pause and explore the new ideas we’ve discussed. If you’d like, you can share the results of your experiments with smaller dimensions or any details about your implementation (e.g., window size, negative sampling, preprocessing) in a new thread, and I can provide further tailored advice. Good luck with your CBOW experiments, and I’m confident you’ll see improvements with these adjustments!
